# Particle Field Animation

This repository contains a MATLAB script to demonstrate the behavior of a charged particle under the influence of magnetic and electric fields using animation.

## Description

The script simulates the motion of a charged particle subjected to given electric and magnetic field magnitudes. It visualizes the particle's trajectory over time, showing the combined effects of these fields on the particle's motion.

## Files

- `ParticleFieldAnimation.m`: The main script for the particle motion animation under magnetic and electric fields.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Open `ParticleFieldAnimation.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the script and input the required parameters when prompted:
    - Magnetic Field magnitude
    - Electric Field magnitude
    - Charge of the particle (+1 for proton, -1 for electron, 0 for neutron)

## Example

1. When prompted, input the following values:
    - Magnetic Field magnitude: `1`
    - Electric Field magnitude: `1`
    - Charge of the particle: `1`

2. The animation will show the trajectory of a proton under the given field conditions.
